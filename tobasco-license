Tobasco's Amazing Clock Wheel is offered free of charge for anyone who wants it. Donations are accepted, of course. All proceeds from donations will go towards helping me get some education in programming.

Donations can be made through PayPal. Go to http://www.riograndemud.com and look for the "Make Donation" button and click it.

The only files on your computer that are affected by this program are Winamp playlist files (*.m3u) so it should be safe to run without disturbing your computer. If anything else happens to your system it is not my fault.

My name is Toby and people call me "Tobasco." I am in no way affiliated with TABASCO® products nor do I claim any sponsorship. Although I use TABASCO® products on much of the food I eat, even while programming, they had nothing to do with this program. 

I'm not changing my nickname and I reserve the right to call myself whatever I want. I have no money so suing me will be of no use to you anyway.
